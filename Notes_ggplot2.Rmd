```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Database: Software

```{r}
software<-read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hmendozar17/R-Learning/master/softwareECSV.csv", header=TRUE)
## nrow(dataHW2) = 149 participants
```


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
